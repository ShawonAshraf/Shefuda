# Shefuda
> A Shefatullah Soundboard app for iOS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShawonAshraf/Shefuda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShawonAshraf/Shefuda)

## Why though?
Recently someone took the generous task of creating sound clips from the famous/infamous facebook live video of Shefatullah and developed a soundboard app for Android. So I thought, why not one for iOS?

## Who is Shefatullah?
Seriously? You should commit Harakiri.

## Platforms Supported
The project was built against iOS 11.4 SDK. Should work on iOS 10 as well (not that I'm going to test that, upto you!)

## Dependencies
`SwiftySound` from `Cocoapods`.

## Running the project
First of all you need a mac with macOS and Xcode installed. No you can't do it on any other OS (not even on windows in bootcamp).

- Install Homebrew from [here](https://brew.sh/)
- Run the following commands
```bash
brew update
brew install ruby
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
- Clone the repo or download as zip.
- `cd` into the folder with `Terminal` or `iTerm2`
- Install the pods
```bash
pod install
```
- Open the `Shefuda.xcworkspace` file. (Opens in Xcode)
- Run it on your device on simulator

## Device Support
Universal

## Side loading on your device
You can do that from Xcode. Just make sure you have your Apple ID. You can follow this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/VvrBbBjP-Hs) or [this one](https://youtu.be/bpyslMcAsgs).
